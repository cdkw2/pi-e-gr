# pi-e-gr
 π, e, φ game!

This Python program prints the digits of π (pi), e (eulers number) and φ (phi) in real-time whild performing tasks everytime a new digit is printed!.

This project is inspired by:

[WinningSequence's](https://www.youtube.com/@winningsequence) "CAN THE NUMBER π BEAT POKÉMON?" where the number π controls Pokémon Sapphire via its digits. Which is streamed live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/winningsequence). I wanted to make something similar to this with some different games, so naturally I asked for the source code on the stream and left a comment on the latest video from the channel. After getting no response I just decided to make it myself! So here I am trying to do something that I actually like in my summer holidays. My predictions are that this project would be ready in about a two weeks from now that is roughly 31st of June, 2023. The project started on 7th of June, 2023 for context.

The .ipynb file gets updated regularly after making changes but the .py file gets updated at the end of my coding hours, because I code primary in jupyter notebook and keep on pushing the files to GitHub as I make small changes (I know it is not the best and can be improved but it is what it is) and when I am off for the day I just download it as .py and upload them to this repository. So yeah, that's how this works. If you have any tips for me like how can I clean this messy code open a issue, I will be sure to answer (I hope so). 

I really enjoyed making this project and it is like 60% done as the entire coding is finished. I just have to select which game I have to get these number to play and figure out how I am going to make them play etc. I also have to look into something that these programs can hosted on, like Firebase or some cloud server etc, I don't know I am not into this stuff. I would also appreciate if that service is free, but at the same time, 24/7 service being free is kinda a lot to expect.

So, my main plan with this is to get three different copies of a game and get all three numbers (π, e, φ) to play them simultaneously and get this streamed on twitch to monitor it all the time. I want to see which number would be able to progress the farthest in the game.

So yeah, that's all so here is a lit of all the stuff that is done and pending:

- C̶o̶d̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶ ̶π̶,̶ ̶e̶,̶ ̶φ̶
- Subsituting all the psudo functions with actual inputs
- Choosing game
- Choosing hosting platform
- Hosting the code
- Testing
- Done!
